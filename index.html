    <p>A 2018 systematic review of colors in work environments collected 40 studies exploring this field 
      Researchers acknowledged that this research is in very early stages, and that reactions to color vary by gender, age, culture, & other background factors. In addition, color in work research is often limited to red, green, & blue, presumably to simplify an very abstract realm of research. Their research as a whole found plenty of consistencies, but many contradictions, such as white being deemed favorable, yet error-producing, and blue producing drowsiness, yet increased well-being. Cool colors also gave a contradiction by seeming to increase and decrease creativity. (Savavibool,  Gatersleben, & Moorapun.) Minguillon et al., 2017, criticized the rampant use of observational research, calling instead for objective, empirical methodology.
      <br><br>
      Elliot (2015) identified that color psychology as a whole is in a “nascent stage of development”, arguing that findings are either far too specific or far too general. Moreover, the wide range of hues available means research will always be limited, because it is impossible to study every single hue. He added that red is often the subjected hue because of its presence in the body, in society, & in nature. Finally, he stated that color research focuses solely on general effects (Does x lead to y?), rather than exploring the specific conditions that yield effects. There is so much context involved in color perception, that begs further research. A 2014 study identified this difference between psychology and context: our physiological, biological responses to color exist in a much different realm than the symbolism our context and culture provides. Red could spark fear due to psychological responses to blood, or it could bring feelings of comfort, with societal connotations of Santa Claus! 
      <br><br>
      In short, there are as many contradictions and flaws in color psychology as there are consistent trends. Researchers are unable to find a “one size fits all” method, but the findings do have plenty of grounding, especially associations of warm vs cool colors, highly chromatic vs neutral colors, and the presence of the most preferred color to an individual. The various details are countless, and as any good, employable researcher knows, this clearly calls for further research.

Work Environment
<br><br>
A review of 40 studies on color brought together research covering Mood & Emotions,
     Physiology & Well-Being, & Work Outcomes: Performance, Productivity, & Creativity. 
     With color preference in general, green & blue are found to be consistently high in the workplace, 
     and white is favored when it comes to neutral work environments, which many workers highly value. 
     Red is considered distracting, and blue has shown effects of drowsiness or fatigue. (Savavibool,  
     Gatersleben, & Moorapun, 2018.) Kurt & Osueke, 2014, found a strong preference for complementary
      colors & a balance between warm & cool colors in our environment. They found that a mix of green, 
      grey, & white, in addition to direct sunlight, was considered inviting. According to their research, 
      white can sometimes be considered monotonous & unsupportive of a healthy environment. 
<br><br>
Work Outcomes <br><br>
In the areas of work outcomes, spaces with a variety of colors were deemed more effective 
than achromatic spaces. White walls appeared to increase errors in work, and while red and 
blue have both had mixed effects, red was found to be helpful in tasks of cognition, 
while blue seemed to be helpful in creative tasks. Productivity was enhanced with 
neutral colors, cool blues, & harmony between warm & cool colors, and decreased with 
cool colors; although in one study there was no relationship between productivity and 
color. Finally, with creativity, cool colors were found to increase and decrease 
creativity in different studies; however, research did find cool colors to be calming, 
& warm colors to be overstimulating. (Savavibool,  Gatersleben, & Moorapun, 2018.) 
<br><br>
A 2015 collection of research further explored color in work, with a focus on red and blue. 
Red was found to improve attention, but could reduce performance with exposure right before 
a challenging cognitive task. Wearing red was also found to create feelings of dominance. 
Red exposure, as based on frontal cortex measurements, was found to increase caution & 
avoidance. Blue, used in ratings of brands/logos, was found to create a sense of trust &
 quality, and blue light was found to increase alertness & productivity, comparable to 
 the alert effects of phones and screens (Elliot).

    <p>Well-Being
      <br><br>
      When we’re not focused on productivity, what colors help us stay calm, relaxed, & happy?
      <br><br>
      When it comes to mood & emotion, green is considered one of the more positive contributors, 
      and blue & green together also had high markings of positive well-being. Blue itself had mixed effects,
       considered more positive than red, but still creating depressive connotations. Red itself is 
       considered stimulating. (Savavibool,  Gatersleben, & Moorapun, 2018.) 
      <br><br>
      Research from ​​Kurt & Osueke in 2014 found associations between green and nature, suggesting a 
      unique relationship between that color and our well-being. They also discussed stimulation & excitement 
      from red as well as warm colors in general. Blue was found to be calming, while red raised blood pressure. 
      This study explored the effects of pink reducing aggression, which could likely be due to social 
      associations between pink & femininity. 
      <br><br>
      A 2017 experiment from Minguillon et al provided an extremely scientific approach to color & relaxation. 
      Comparing blue and white light exposure after bringing participants to baseline stress, they found that
       blue lights sped up the rate as which participants relaxed & recovered from the initial stress. Blue 
       rooms were also found to decrease cortisol levels, showing a strong case for blue color & light in 
       a relaxing environment. Whey blue, violet, & green rooms were compared to yellow & red ones, 
      feelings of relaxation increased and heart rate decreased in the blue, violet, & green rooms, 
      suggesting a potential influence from color wavelengths.</p>
